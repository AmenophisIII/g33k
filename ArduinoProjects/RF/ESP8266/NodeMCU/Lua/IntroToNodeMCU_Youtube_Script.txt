1. Hardware tour:
	a. No Arduino
	b. FTDI USB Serial is only needed while programming
	c. 5V to 3.3V resistor ladder
	d. 1K pullup for switch, 1K current limiting resistor for LED

2. NodeMCU is a complete firmware replacement
	a. No more AT commands
	b. LUA is an interpreted language similar to Javascript
	c. Show the samples on NodeMCU website
	d. Thank Hackaday and Marc and Xavi from Barcelona
	e. Thank NodeMCU team

3. Talking to the ESP
	a. CoolTerm
	b. Instead of AT commands, the terminal is a LUA interpreter 
		running on the ESP!
	c. Type snippets
	d. Show paste error. Show line delay
	e. Show that now paste works
	f. Explain Blink code

4. Show blink working
	a. At 1000
	b. At 200
	c. GPIO 0 

5. Next video
